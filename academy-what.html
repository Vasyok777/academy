								<h4 class="academy-what__subtitle">Introduction</h4>
								<p class="academy-what__text">Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake (PoS) and the
									introduction of sharding are vital components of its Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. PoS
									reduces energy consumption by replacing miners with validators, who are selected to
									create new blocks based on the amount of ETH they stake.</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">Meanwhile, sharding increases transaction speed by
									partitioning the Ethereum network into smaller pieces (shards), with each capable of
									independently processing transactions and smart contracts. The shift from <a
										href="#" class='academy-what__link'>PoW</a> to PoS
									enables secure and efficient sharding by randomly assigning validators to specific
									shards, preventing manipulation and enhancing performance.</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">The Ethereum Cancun upgrade represents an important
									advancement in the Ethereum blockchain, aimed at fortifying the network's
									scalability, security, and overall efficiency. This upgrade introduces the concept
									of proto-dank sharding, an important step toward optimizing data management and
									enhancing transaction affordability within the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">By leveraging innovative data storage techniques, the
									Ethereum Cancun upgrade is poised to revolutionize the way the network processes
									transactions, paving the way for a more accessible and seamless user experience.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="academy-what__block" id='Understanding-the-Ethereum-Cancun-Upgrade'>
								<h4 class="academy-what__subtitle">Understanding the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade</h4>
								<p class="academy-what__text">The Ethereum Cancun upgrade (also known as the
									“Cancun-Deneb” upgrade) is a concerted effort by Ethereum to bolster its
									infrastructure and address unresolved issues after the <a href="#"
										class='academy-what__link'>Shanghai</a> upgrade.</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">The Cancun upgrade is based on five Ethereum Improvement
									Proposals (EIPs): <a href="#" class='academy-what__link'>EIP-4844</a>, EIP-1153,
									EIP-4788, and EIP-6780. Together, the
									implementation of these EIPs will provide many benefits, including improved
									scalability, enhanced data storage and availability, and reduced transaction costs.
								</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">With a primary focus on optimizing the execution layer
									(Layer 1), the Cancun upgrade prepares the network for the future implementation of
									full data sharding, a vital component in Ethereum's long-term development strategy.
								</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">Sharding refers to splitting a blockchain database into
									smaller portions, called shards, for higher efficiency, and the Cancun upgrade
									introduces a specific type of sharding known as proto-danksharding (discussed
									below).</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">The goal of the Cancun upgrade is to increase the
									network’s <a href="#" class='academy-what__text'>transactions per second</a> (TPS),
									aligning with Ethereum's roadmap's "Surge"
									phase, aiming to scale performance to 100,000+ TPS.</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">The Cancun upgrade – along with the subsequent Deneb
									upgrade – represents a significant milestone in Ethereum's journey towards
									establishing itself as a leading decentralized finance platform.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="">
								<h4 class="academy-what__subtitle">Danksharding and Proto-Danksharding</h4>
								<p class="academy-what__text">Danksharding and proto-danksharding are different
									iterations of the sharding technology developed for Ethereum. Named after Ethereum
									researcher Dankrad Feist, danksharding is a type of sharding that serves as the
									final phase of the <a href="#" class='academy-what__link'>Ethereum 2.0</a>
									(Serenity) upgrade. It concentrates on optimizing
									data availability for rollups within the Ethereum network.</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">Technically speaking, danksharding is a design that
									introduces the concept of a merged market fee. While traditional sharding has
									different blocks and block proposers for each shard, there is only one block
									proposer in danksharding. In simple terms, danksharding can enhance transaction
									processing and streamline data storage by simplifying the sharding architecture and
									prioritizing data management.</p>
								<p class="academy-what__text">In the context of the upcoming upgrade, proto-danksharding
									(introduced by <a href="#" class='academy-what__link'>EIP-4844</a>) serves as a
									prototype of danksharding. It’s a temporary
									solution that can significantly reduce gas fees associated with rollups before the
									complete implementation of the danksharding framework.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="">
								<h4 class="academy-what__subtitle">Blob-carrying transactions</h4>
								<p class="academy-what__text">Blob-carrying transactions were introduced along with
									proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) to help reduce gas fees. Blob-carrying transactions
									allow the temporary storage and retrieval of off-chain data, meaning extra data can
									be added to Ethereum transactions in a more cost-effective way.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="academy-what__block" id='Benefits-of-the-Ethereum-Cancun-Upgrade'>
								<h4 class="academy-what__subtitle">Benefits of the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade</h4>
								<p class="academy-what__text">As we’ve discussed, the Ethereum Cancun upgrade promises a
									range of benefits, including faster transaction processing, reduced transaction
									costs, optimized data management, and improved cross-chain communication. By
									introducing the concept of blob-carrying transactions, the upgrade aims to
									streamline data processing and enhance overall network efficiency.</p>

									significant leap forward in Ethereum's quest for improved scalability, efficiency,
									and user experience. By introducing proto-danksharding and laying the groundwork for
									future advancements, the Ethereum Cancun Upgrade will likely enhance the realm of

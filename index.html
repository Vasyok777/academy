								<h4 class="crypto-subtitle">What's a cryptocurrency?</h4>
								<p class="crypto-text">A cryptocurrency is just like a digital form of cash. You can use
									it to pay friends for your share of the bar tab, buy that new pair of socks you've
									been eyeing up üëÄ, or book flights ‚úàÔ∏è and hotels üè® for your next holiday. Because
									cryptocurrency is digital, it can also be sent to friends and family anywhere in the
									world.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Just like PayPal or bank transfers, right?Well, not really. It's
									way more interesting!</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">You see, traditional online payment gateways are owned by
									organizations. They hold your money for you, and you need to ask them to transfer it
									on your behalf when you want to spend it.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">In cryptocurrencies, there isn't an organization. You, your
									friends, and thousands of others can act as your own banks by running free software.
									Your computer connects with other people's computers, meaning you communicate
									directly ‚Äì no middlemen required!</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">To use cryptocurrency, you don't need to sign up for a website
									with an email address and password. You can download a wide variety of apps onto
									your smartphone to begin sending and receiving within minutes.</p>

									What about that ‚Çø Bitcoin thing your friend or family member
									keeps talking about? That's the original cryptocurrency, and, to date, the most
									popular.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="crypto-main__block">
								<p class="crypto-text">Bitcoin provided the foundation for many other cryptocurrencies.
									Some were based on the same software, while others took a very different approach.
									Ok, but what's the difference between all the cryptocurrencies?</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">To even make a list of all the different cryptocurrencies would
									take us weeks. Some are faster than others, some are more private, some are more
									secure, and some are more programmable.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">There's a common saying in the cryptocurrency space: <a href="#"
										class='crypto-link'>Do Your Own
										Research </a>(or DYOR). We're not saying that to be rude, we promise. It just
									means that
									you shouldn't take information from a single source as the truth.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text bold">Before investing your money into a particular project, make
									sure you do your due diligence.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="crypto-main__block">
								<h4 class="crypto-subtitle">What is blockchain?</h4>
								<p class="crypto-text">Don't be spooked by the technobabble that people use to describe
									"blockchain." A blockchain is just a database. It isn't a particularly sophisticated
									one, either - you could create it in a spreadsheet with minimal effort.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">There are some peculiarities with these databases. The first is
									that blockchains are append-only. That means that you can only add information - you
									can't just click on a cell and delete stuff that you've already added, or change it
									in any way.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">The second is that each entry (called a block) in the database is
									cryptographically linked to the last entry. In plain English, each new entry must
									contain a sort of digital fingerprint (hash) of the last one.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">And that's it! Since each fingerprint points back to the last
									one, you end up with a chain of blocks. Or - as the cool kids like to call it - a
									blockchain.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">A blockchain is immutable: if you change a block, it changes the
									fingerprint. And since that fingerprint is included in the next block, the next
									block is changed too. And since that block's fingerprint... well, you get the idea.
									You end up with a domino effect where any change becomes evident. You can't alter
									any information without everyone noticing.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="crypto-main__block">
								<h4 class="crypto-subtitle">Is that it?</h4>
								<p class="crypto-text">Underwhelmed? That's fair. The innovation here isn't some
									cumbersome alternative to Google Sheets. It's that everyone can download blocks from
									other people on the network to build identical copies of the blockchain on their
									computers. That's what the software we mentioned earlier does.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Suppose that you and your friends Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dan are
									running the software. You might say "I want to send five coins to Bob." So you send
									that instruction to everyone else, but the coins aren't sent to Bob immediately.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Carol might decide at the same time to send Alice five coins. She
									also sends her instruction out to the network. At any time, a participant can gather
									up the pending instructions to create a block.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text bold">If anyone can make a block, what stops them from cheating?
								</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">It probably seems very attractive to you to create a block that
									says "Bob pays me a million coins." Or to start buying Lamborghinis and fur coats
									from Carol by making transactions with funds you don't own.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">
									Well, that's not how it works. Because of some cryptography, game theory, and
									something called a consensus algorithm, the system prevents you from spending funds
									you shouldn't be able to spend.
								</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Did you know all that already, and just want to learn how to
									trade or invest? Let's get onto that next.</p>

								<h4 class="crypto-subtitle">Trading</h4>
								<p class="crypto-text">As you might have heard, blockchain and cryptocurrencies are
									already used in a lot of different areas. Undoubtedly, one of the biggest current
									use cases is speculation.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Trading generally implies a shorter-term approach to generating
									profit. Traders may jump in and out of positions all the time. But how do they know
									when to get in and out?</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">One of the most common ways to make sense of the cryptocurrency
									market is through an approach called technical analysis (TA). Technical analysts
									look at price history, charts, and other types of market data to find bets that have
									a good chance of returning a profit.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">You must be dying to get started right away. And technically, you
									could. It's that easy! But, like most things worth pursuing, trading is hard! It
									would take us a long time to talk about all that you need to keep in mind.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="crypto-main__block">
								<h4 class="crypto-subtitle">Investing</h4>
								<p class="crypto-text">Investors look for long-term bets based on the fundamentals of an
									investment. For example, how much profit a company is making. While cryptocurrencies
									are a new and unique type of assets, they can also be viewed through a similar lens.
								</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Many Bitcoin investors follow the "<a href="#"
										class='crypto-link'>HODL</a>" philosophy. This means
									that they believe so deeply in the success of Bitcoin that they don't intend to sell
									for a long time. But don't take their word for it! Read our <a href="#"
										class='crypto-link'>extensive Bitcoin guide</a>
									and decide for yourself.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">After going through that, you may decide that you want to become
									a Bitcoin HODLer. Well, you could become one in a matter of minutes. Just go to the
									<a href="#" class='crypto-link'>Buy Crypto</a> page and follow the instructions.
								</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">The onboarding process is smooth and quick. You don't have to
									jump in with large amounts, either. You could start with as little as 15 dollars!
									So, what is some mind candy that you should be looking into related to crypto
									investing?</p>
							</div>
							<div class="crypto-main__block">
								<h4 class="crypto-subtitle">Passive income</h4>
								<p class="crypto-text">So far, we've talked about trading and investing. These methods
									generally require a lot of time, which not everyone has. If you're one of those busy
									but efficient people, we have some other options for you.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">As Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all
									time, said: "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work
									until you die."</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Good news, the world of cryptocurrency offers many opportunities
									to <a href="#" class="crypto-link">earn passive income</a>. You can basically use
									your crypto holdings to make more
									crypto!</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Why isn't everyone doing this? Well, they probably don't know.
									But now you do!</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">One of the ways to earn passive income is by securely lending
									your holdings to other people. In exchange for the opportunity to borrow your funds,
									they'll pay interest to you.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Besides, you may have heard about Bitcoin mining. It generally
									involves a lot of loud and expensive machines churning away for Bitcoin rewards.
									However, there are other ways to secure a cryptocurrency network. One of these is
									through a process called staking. And spoiler alert, it doesn't involve meat.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="crypto-main__block">
								<h4 class="crypto-subtitle">Privacy and Security</h4>
								<p class="crypto-text">We're a cryptocurrency website, but we also ‚ù§Ô∏è privacy and
									security topics ‚Äì and you should, too!</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">The digital age brought with it some serious innovation. Your
									fridge can text you when you forget to close the door, you can summon your car from
									a smartphone app, and it looks like you'll soon be receiving mail by drone.</p>
								<p class="crypto-text">Unfortunately, there's also been innovation in ways to steal your
									sensitive data ‚Äì something we unknowingly produce A LOT of. Do you know the best way
									to deal with ransomware? Or the steps you can take to stop websites from finding out
									where you're browsing from?</p>
							</div>
							<div class="crypto-main__block">
								<h4 class="crypto-subtitle">Well, that about brings us up to speed!</h4>
								<p class="crypto-text">Hopefully you can leave this guide with a better understanding of
